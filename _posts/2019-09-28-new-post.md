Signal is a Dublin-based type foundry and drawing office specializing in type design, lettering, and typographic branding. I really like their simple yet contemporary approach. Font to try: Center Slab.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Since 2016 Displaay is a small independent Type Foundry and Design Studio founded by Martin Vácha based in Prague, Czech Republic. Fonts are affordable and unique, I really enjoy the Glyphs tester and the fact that you can download a test version of each font.
<br>

### [THE DESIGNERS FOUNDRY](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/)<br>

<br>

<br>
TDF is a hand-picked international team of type designers. On their website, there is a ton of options and prices are ok. Without a doubt my favorite is Superspitze. I owned a copy now so just need to do something with it :)
